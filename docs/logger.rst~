Main decisions
==============

  1. First let's try creating the app only using python
  2. Check the speed and if it's too slow try next steps
  3. Search about methods to integrate Python and C++

    * Pybind11: It was the first I tried because read good references about it and also seem to be the easiest to use. Unfortunately I could only use it with Python 2.7, and couldn't integrate with Python 3.6 (version used to develop the first part. Then, as Pybind11 is based on Boost.Python y will try this now and check if can make it work properly Pybind11__.

    * Boost.Python: `link to Boost.Python`__.
